Configuration of URL Prefixes
In your __init__.py file inside the api/v1/views directory, you defined two blueprints (app_views and auth) with specific URL prefixes:

python
Copy code
# api/v1/views/__init__.py

from flask import Blueprint

app_views = Blueprint("app_views", __name__, url_prefix="/api/v1")
auth = Blueprint("auth", __name__, url_prefix="/auth")

# Importing all your views here (example)
from api.v1.views.students import *
from api.v1.views.results import *
# Import other views as needed
This configuration means that any routes registered under app_views will have /api/v1 as a prefix, and routes under auth will have /auth as a prefix.
